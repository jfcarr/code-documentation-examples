Doxygen doesn't support Rust, but Rust has a capable documentation generator built in to Cargo.

To generate documentation:

* ```cd simple-app```
* Issue this command: ```cargo doc```

You can then access the generated documentation by opening target/doc/simple_app/index.html in your browser.  You can also access a sample set in example-docs.
